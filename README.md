# PHP File Handling Bug: Ignoring fclose() and Incomplete File Open Check

This repository demonstrates a common, yet often overlooked, error in PHP file handling: ignoring the return value of `fclose()` and not fully validating the file open operation.  Improper handling of these can lead to resource leaks or unexpected behavior.

The `bug.php` file showcases the problematic code. The `bugSolution.php` file provides a corrected version that addresses these issues.

## Bug:

The original code lacks explicit error checking for `fclose()` and has an incomplete file open check, potentially leading to errors.

## Solution:

The solution includes explicit checks for both `fopen()` and `fclose()`, ensuring that all file operations are handled correctly and potential errors are caught.
