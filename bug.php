```php
$file = fopen("path/to/file.txt", "r");
if ($file) {
    // Process the file
    fclose($file);
} else {
    // Handle file opening error
    echo "Error opening file.";
}
```
This code has a potential error:  It doesn't explicitly check the return value of `fclose()`. While `fclose()` usually succeeds, it can fail (return false) if there's an error during the closing process (e.g., disk full). Ignoring this failure can lead to resource leaks or unexpected behavior.

Another subtle issue:
It only checks if the file handle is truthy. In cases where the file opens in a mode other than read, the handle could be valid but still not contain data.
